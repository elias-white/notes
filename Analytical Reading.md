[[Mortimer J. Adler]] describes three stages of analytical reading:
#### 1. Stage One - Rules for Finding What a Book is About
- Classify the book according to kind and subject matter
- State what the book is about with the utmost brevity
- Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole
- Define the problem or problems the author has tried to solve

#### 2. Stage Two - Rules For Interpreting a Books Contents
- Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words
- Grasp the author's leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences
- Know the author's arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences
- Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and of the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve

#### 3. Rules for Criticising a Book as a Communication of Knowledge
- Do not begin criticism until you have completed your outline and interpretation of the book (don't criticise unless you can "I understand")
- Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously
- Demonstrate that you recognise the difference between knowledge and personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgement you make
