Abductive Reasoning, or abduction, is a type of reasoning that creates abductive arguments, arguments that are based on observations and experience. An abductive arguments conclusion can be *likely* or *not likely* and is the best possible explanation for particularly phenomenon occurring. 


# Abductive vs [[Inductive Reasoning]]
Induction is a direct extrapolation from current data. If the sun comes up every morning, you may inductively conclude that the sun will come up tomorrow morning. By contrast, abduction is inference to the best _explanation_. If the grass is wet outside, you may use abductive reasoning to conclude that it's probably raining.
