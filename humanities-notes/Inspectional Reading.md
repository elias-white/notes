Inspectional reading is the second [[Levels of Reading | levels of reading]] described by [[Mortimer J. Adler]] and is all about discovering whether you should invest time and effort in reading the book at a higher level. It's about uncovering the structural elements of the book and discovering the general gist of what the book is about. 

Some suggested activities to undertake at this level include:
1. Read the title page, preface and subtitles
2. Study the Table of Contents
3. Check the index for critical terms
4. If it exists, read the publishers blurb
5. Skim summary paragraphs of key chapters
6. Read a few pages here or there, the epilogue and final pages for grand statements
