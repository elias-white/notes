A proposition is a statement that can either be true or false. It is declarative statement about how the world *is*. 

# Nonpropositions
Some examples of nonpropositions are questions, commands, exclamations, wishes and exhortations. These are statements, but not statements about how the world is so they fail to meet the definition of a proposition.
