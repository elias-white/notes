The Five Ways are [[Thomas Aquinas]]' five arguments for the existence of God written in the [[Summa Theologiae]].

The five ways are:
# First Argument: Argument from Motion
1. Objects are in motion.
2. If something is in motion, then it must be caused to be in motion by something outside of itself.
3. There can be no infinite chain of movers/movees.
4. So, there is a first, unmoved mover.
5. Therefore, God exists.

## Criticisms
The underlying assumption to P1/P2 is that if an object is in motion, it must be caused to move byh something outside of itself. This comes from [[Aristotle]]'s physics. Modern day Newtonian physics state that an object can remain in motion forever without there being any outside force that sustains its motion. 

# Second Argument: Argument from Causality
1. Some events cause other events.
2. If an event happens, then it must be caused by something outside of itself.
3. There can be no infinite cause/effect chains.
4. So, there is a first, uncaused cause.
5. Therefore, God exists.

## Criticisms
- P2 contradicts P4
- The conclusion that a single cause does not follow from the premises, rather it should state *at least one cause*. Sober refers to this as the Birthday Fallacy -- as an analogy to the argument is that every person has a birthday -- a day on which he or she was born. Therefore, there is a single day that is everyones birthday. 
- In both the Argument from Motion and Argument from Causality, the final premises fail to directly infer the conclusion that God exists. The first mover, or cause, could have been the big bang or other similar event.

# Third Argument: Contingency
1. Contingent things exist.
2. Each contingent thing has a time at which it fails to exist ("contingent things are not imnipresent")
3. So, if everyything were contingent, there would be a time at which nothing exists (call this an "empty time")
4. That empty time would have been in the past
5. If the world were empty at one time, it would be empty forever after (a conservation principle)
6. So, if everything were contingent, nothing would exist now
7. But clearly, the world is not empty (see premise 1)
8. So, there exists a being who is not contingent
9. Hence, God Exists

The summary of this argument is that contingent things depend on something else for existence, while necessary things do not. Contingent things exist

## Criticisms



# Fourth Argument: Properties That Come in Degrees
1. Objects have properties to greater or lesser extents.
2. If an object has a property to a lesser extent, then there exists some other object that has a property to the maximum possible degree (call this a maximum exemplar of the property)
3. So, there is an entity that has all the properties to the maximum possible degree
4. Therefore, God exists

## Criticisms
