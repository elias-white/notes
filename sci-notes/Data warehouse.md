Data warehouses are optimised for read-only analytics. They contain data from multiple data sources and are organised for reading and aggregating data. 

Data warehouses are optimised for [[Massively Parallel Processing]], a [[Database Schemas#Denormalised Schemas|denormalised schema]] and [[Dimensional modeling]].

Smaller subsets of data within data warehouses are called [[Data marts]].
