Database Design attempts to answer the question: *How should we organise and manage our data?*

There are a few quesitons to ask (in no order of importance):
- [[ Schemas ]]: How should my data be organised?
- [[ Normalisation ]]: Should my data have minimal dependency and redundancy?
- [[ Views ]]: What joins will be done most often?
- [[ Access Control ]]: Should all users have the same access?
- [[ Database Management Systems | DBMS  ]]: SQL, NoSQL or other?

The answer to these questions all depends on how the data will be used in production.

### How can we store data?
1. [[Structured data]]
2. [[Unstructured data]]
3. [[Semi-structured data]]
