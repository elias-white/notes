Every [[Polynomial]] that is a difference of squares can be factored by applying the following formula:

$a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)$

Note that $a$ and $b$ in the pattern can be any algebraic expression. For example, for $a=x$ and $b=2$, we get the following:

$x^2-4=(x+2)(x-2)$

Other examples:
1. $9x^2-25y^2$
2. The perfect square of $9$ is $3$ and the perfect square of $25$ is $5$. 
3. Therefore,
 $9x^2-25y^2=(3x+5y)(3x-5y)$
