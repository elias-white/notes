In [[math]], factorisation is the process of putting an expanded expression back into brackets. It can help simplify complex expressions. 

##### Factorising a [[monic quadratic]]:
$x^2-11x+24$
1. Find the product of two numbers that equal the [[Constant]] $24$ and and add up to the [[coefficient]] $-11$. 
2. The answer is $-3$ and $-8$.
3. Therefore: $(x-3)(x-8)$

We can test if it is the right answer by multiplying it back out. 

##### Factorising a [[Non-monic Quadratic]]
$3x^2-10x-8$
1. The coefficient of $x$ is $3$. The constant is $-8$.
2. Multiply the coefficient by the constant. 
$=-24$
3. Find the product of $-24$ that add to the middle integer $-10$.
$=-12\ and +2$
4. Replace $10x$ with these two factors.
= $3x^2-12x+2x-8$
5. Put the two terms into parenthesis.
= $(3x^2-12x)(2x-8)$
6. 'Bring out' the common factors, if any, of each expression.
=$3x(x-4)+2(x-4)$
7. The numbers that were *brought out* form their own expression, and the common expression $x-4$ forms the other.
=$(3x+2)(x-4)$
