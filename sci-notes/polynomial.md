In [[math]], a polynomial is an expression that is made up of many terms. The expression can be composed of variables, [[Constant | constants]],  and exponents that are combined using addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (no division operation on a variable).

A polynomial can be classified based on the number of terms it has:
- [[Monomial]] (one term: $5x$)
- [[Binomial]] (two terms: $-5x+10a$)
- [[Trinomial]] (three terms: $5x+10x+a$)
