In [[math]], a quadratic equation is any equation that can be formatted as $ax^2 + bx + c$ where x is unknown but $abc$ are known and $a\neq0$.

If $a=0$ then it would be a [[linear equation]]. 
If $a=1$ then it is called a [[monic quadratic]]. e.g. $x^2-11x+24$
If $a$ is neither $0$ or $1$, then it is a [[Non-monic Quadratic]]. e.g. $3x^2-10x-8$
